Num-Py Gumbo, v0.5
Written by Sean McKean, with some code heavily inspired and/or copied
from source on the web (see credits below).

To run the source code version, make sure you have the following programs
and libraries installed (if you are on MS Windows, you can alternatively
run the executable version without having these on your system -- this
version should be available on the internet at the same place as the
source release):

    Python >= v2.6.5  (http://www.python.org/)
    Pygame >= v1.9.1  (http://www.pygame.org/)
    numpy  >= v1.3.0  (http://numpy.scipy.org/)

Source run instructions (you have the above installed):
    Type  python main.py  at a command prompt in the main directory to
    run the full demo suite. You can alternatively run the separate
    effects by changing to the 'effects' directory and typing
    python <effect>.py , replacing <effect> with the file name.
    Of course, on many systems you may also be able to run the python
    source files by double-clicking them in a file browser.

Executable run instructions:
    Run the file 'Num-Py Gumbo.exe' in the main release directory.

Title screen directions:
    The effects in the menu can be selected with the arrow keys, left
    mouse button, mouse wheel, or by typing the first letter of the demo
    name. Type the enter key or click on the animated square in the bowl
    shape to run the selected effect. The controls for the individual
    demos are explained in the description text. To exit an effect and
    go back to the title, press the Escape or Enter key, or to quit
    altogether, click on the window titlebar's close button. To take a
    snapshot of the window at any time, press control-F12; snapshots
    will be saved in the 'snaps' directory.
    
Note: Many important settings for each effect can be changed in
      the 'settings.cfg' file. Just follow the directions in
      the file comments.

Credits:
    Music titled 'Net Surfer' provided by JosSs off the internet.
    The .ogg version is a converted copy of the original .mod file,
    which is included in this distribution in case you prefer mod files.

    Many of the demo effects and paletted images were obtained from a
    series of well written articles entitled "The Art of Demomaking"
    that were featured on the flipcode website. The author of the series
    was Alex J. Champandard, who thankfully released the material in the
    public domain. Although the effects were originally written for
    MS-DOS in C++, I believe the ideas they contain are well worth
    learning, which is why I included them here. To read the articles,
    direct your web browser to < http://www.flipcode.com/demomaking/ >.

    Many thanks to these people for their expertise and their
    non-commercial attitude toward sharing data.
